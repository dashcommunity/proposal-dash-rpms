  "body": "# Proposal:<br />Dash Core for Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL\r\n\r\nDash Core software professionally packaged, tested, maintained, and delivered\r\nfor the Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL linux platforms.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a request to fund the ongoing process of building, packaging, and\r\ndelivery of Dash Core code for the premier family of linux operating systems:\r\nRed Hat -- Fedora, CentOS and RHEL. I have been building packages for this line\r\nof operating systems for approximately 8 months now and will continue to do so,\r\nproposal accepted or not. This is a plea to help fund my efforts as I improve\r\nand expand the scope of what I am already doing.\r\n\r\n*...more detail...*\r\n\r\nA mature software application ideally needs mature packaging for the various\r\npermutations of operating system platforms on which it runs. Examples: for\r\nUbuntu this means .deb (for apt-get automation), for MacOS this means .pkg, etc.\r\nFor the Red Hat linux family of operating systems -- Fedora, CentOS, RHEL --\r\nthis means RPM packages (.rpm).\r\n\r\nThe advantages are that you build these packages consistently and they allow\r\npredictable and easy installation for users. They pull in the dependencies they\r\nneed without the user having to think about them, and the operating system can\r\ntrack and manage updates cleanly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nToday, I developed the packaging specs, build and digitally sign packages and\r\nmake them available. I have also written installation configuration instruction\r\ntailered to these builds and these platforms. But there is a lot more to be done\r\nto really professionalize the product for this family of operating systems.\r\n\r\n**Who am I?** I am dAgrarian (forums), taw00 (github), t0dd and agrarian (other\r\nplaces).\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\nI build and test on a number of local virtual and VPS instances for both stable\r\n(currently 0.12.0.58) and testnet (0.12.1) Dash Core. This will continue\r\nindefinitely and expand in scope.\r\n\r\n##### Deliverables\r\n\r\n* Source packages: <https://github.com/taw00/dashcore-srpms>\r\n* Binary packages: <https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0BT-eTEFVLORG03ck1tem1idEE>\r\n* General usage instruction: <https://drive.google.com/open?id=18qwFkDKfyZhvecuR5kxiIKmPsjPZjFhRY0EsfHYbD7I>\r\n* Tailored testnet masternode guidance: <https://gist.github.com/taw00/e978f862ee1ad66722e16bcc8cf18ca5>\r\n* You can find many of my announcements in the Dash Forums such as [this one](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/12-1-testnet-testing-phase-two-ignition.10818/page-8#post-108491), [this one](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/testnet-masternode-guide-for-fedora-centos-rhel.11950/), and [this one](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/12-1-testnet-testing-phase-two-ignition.10818/page-6#post-106852) (I don't announce every test build)\r\n\r\nAspirationally, I strive to...\r\n\r\n* Drive Dash Core into Fedora's formal release process and official repositories\r\n* Drive the build process into the Dash Core Team's formal release processes\r\n* Expand the set of packages beyond core, for example, the Electrum wallet, Sentinel, etc.\r\n* Make Dash Core SELinux-friendly\r\n* Contribute documentation as needed\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\n\r\nTestnet packaging is rebuilt and released regularly several times a week, time\r\ndependent. Often daily. I am in communication with the Dash Core Team, but not a\r\nmember of that team.\r\n\r\nI hope to eventually fold the packaging into to Fedora's more formal release\r\nengineering infrastructure and have Dash Core become automagically available to,\r\nat least, all Fedora users. Eventually, the goal would be to integrate fully\r\ninto the Dash Core Team development and release engineering process, though with\r\nmy continued participation.\r\n\r\n##### Milestones\r\n\r\nWhat is left undone is packaging and automating some of items beyond core, in\r\nparticular and in the shorter term, building and packaging Sentinel. Also,\r\nperhaps, adding in items like Dashman and other community delivered tools.\r\n\r\nTimeline and goals:\r\n\r\n* Dash Core testnet: all builds within one week of availability.\r\n* Dash Core stable: all builds within several days of availability.\r\n* Streamlining and re-org of current repositories: end of year, 2016\r\n* Sentinel: Q1 2017\r\n* Electrum: unscoped at this point.\r\n* Released to Fedora official repositories: Q1 2017 -- dependent on Fedora administrative acceptance\r\n\r\nI have pored 8 months into what has been delivered already, and the project is\r\nongoing and indefinite. There is no \"end date\" to this effort, of course.\r\n\r\n### Budget\r\n\r\nI use a personal linux machine (and virtualization), and several VPS instances\r\nfor development, packaging, and testing. These have their cost, but it is not\r\nextreme. If accepted into the Fedora build system, some build costs will be\r\nabstracted, and I will be able to leverage a larger talent pool of packaging\r\nexperts and automated professional testing. Additionally, that will expand the\r\nsupportable architectures for Dash Core (I only test 64 Intel), but that is a\r\nless critical side benefit. Local personal testing will continue though.\r\n\r\n**Most of my cost is time. Sometimes, *a lot* of time.**\r\n\r\n* Hard costs:\r\n  - Personal developer laptop: $0 for now\r\n  - VPS instances for testing: 3 x $5 per month\r\n* Time: est. ave. 10 hours a week at $50 per hour, let's call it $2000 per month\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove we ballparked $2000 per month on the open market or 226 DASH / month (as\r\nof this writing, $8.84/DASH). But, for now, I am really just asking for an\r\noffsetting donation of DASH for my time. So I propose...\r\n\r\n#### Terms\r\n\r\n* **1000 DASH total**\r\n * **166.66666667 DASH per month**\r\n * **6 months**\r\n\r\nAfter 6 months, we will examine at how things are going and likely renew with a\r\nsimilar proposal.\r\n\r\n### Closing\r\n\r\nThe Red Hat family of linux distributions needs professional build, testing, and\r\npackaging. I am providing some of that now and want to continue doing that well\r\ninto the future. The goodwill of the community is compensation enough, but if\r\nyou can find it in you to help monetarily, it would be most welcome. Thank you!\r\n",
