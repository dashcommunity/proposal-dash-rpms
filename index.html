<p>Dash Core software professionally packaged, tested, maintained, and delivered
for the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a>,
and
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">RHEL</a>
linux platforms.</p>

<h3>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This is a request to fund the ongoing process of building, packaging, and
delivery of Dash Core code for the premier family of linux operating systems:
Red Hat -- Fedora, CentOS and RHEL. I have been building packages for this line
of operating systems for approximately 8 months now and will continue to do so,
proposal accepted or not. This is a plea to help fund my efforts as I improve
and expand the scope of what I am already doing.</p>

<p><em>...more detail...</em></p>

<p>A mature software application ideally needs mature packaging for the various
permutations of operating system platforms on which it runs. Examples: for
Ubuntu this means .deb (for apt-get automation), for MacOS this means .pkg, etc.
For the Red Hat linux family of operating systems -- Fedora, CentOS, RHEL --
this means RPM packages (.rpm).</p>

<p>The advantages are that you build these packages consistently and they allow
predictable and easy installation for users. They pull in the dependencies they
need without the user having to think about them, and the operating system can
track and manage updates cleanly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Aspirationally, there is opportunaty to have Dash Core shipped with the Fedora
operating system by default. More or that later...</p>

<p>Today, I developed the packaging specs, build and digitally sign packages and
make them available. I have also written installation configuration instruction
tailered to these builds and these platforms. But there is a lot more to be done
to really professionalize the product for this family of operating systems.</p>

<p><em>All of this would set Dash at least on par with Bitcoin, and establish delivery
professionalism certainly ahead of other crypto-currencies.</em></p>

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong> I am dAgrarian (forums), taw00 (github), t0dd and agrarian (other
places).</p>

<h3>
<a id="scope" class="anchor" href="#scope" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope</h3>

<p>I build and test on a number of local virtual and VPS instances for both stable
(currently 0.12.0.58) and testnet (0.12.1) Dash Core. This will continue
indefinitely and expand in scope.</p>

<h5>
<a id="deliverables" class="anchor" href="#deliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deliverables</h5>

</li>
<li>You can find many of my announcements in the Dash Forums such as <a href="https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/12-1-testnet-testing-phase-two-ignition.10818/page-8#post-108491">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/testnet-masternode-guide-for-fedora-centos-rhel.11950/">this one</a>, and <a href="https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/12-1-testnet-testing-phase-two-ignition.10818/page-6#post-106852">this one</a> (I don't announce every test build)</li>
</ul>

<p>Aspirationally, I strive to...</p>

<ul>
<li>Drive Dash Core into Fedora's formal release process and official repositories</li>
<li>Drive the build process into the Dash Core Team's formal release processes</li>
<li>Expand the set of packages beyond core, for example, the Electrum wallet, Sentinel, etc.</li>
<li>Make Dash Core SELinux-friendly (security enhanced linux)</li>
<li>Contribute documentation as needed (see examples above)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="schedule" class="anchor" href="#schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Schedule</h3>

<p>Packaging is rebuilt and released regularly (currently several times a week
because we are testing and finalizing 12.1), time dependent. I am in
communication with the Dash Core Team, but not a member of that team.</p>

<p>I hope to eventually fold the packaging into to Fedora's more formal release
engineering infrastructure and have Dash Core become automagically available to,
at least, all Fedora users. Eventually, the goal would be to integrate fully
into the Dash Core Team development as well and release engineering process,
though likely with my continued participation.</p>

<h5>
<a id="milestones" class="anchor" href="#milestones" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Milestones</h5>

<p>What is left undone is packaging and automating some of items beyond core, in
particular and in the shorter term, building and packaging Sentinel. Also,
perhaps, adding in items like Dashman and other community delivered tools. A
whole suite of tooling.</p>

<p>Timeline and goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dash Core testnet: all builds within one week of availability.</li>
<li>Dash Core mainnet: all builds within several days of availability.</li>
<li>Underlying OS updates: Test and release all packaged offerings in conjunction with operating system updates. Fedora, for example, issues a new release every six months.</li>
<li>Streamlining and re-org of current repositories: End of year, 2016</li>
<li>Sentinel: Q1 2017</li>
<li>Electrum: Unscoped at this point.</li>
<li>Released to Fedora official repositories: Q1 2017 -- dependent on Fedora administrative acceptance</li>
</ul>

<p>I have pored 8 months into what has been delivered already, and the project is
ongoing and indefinite. There is no "end date" to this effort, of course.</p>

<h3>
<a id="budget" class="anchor" href="#budget" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Budget</h3>

<p>I use a personal linux machine (and virtualization), and several VPS instances
for development, packaging, and testing. These have their cost, but it is not
extreme. If accepted into the Fedora build system, some build costs will be
abstracted, and I will be able to leverage a larger talent pool of packaging
experts and automated professional testing. Additionally, that will expand the
supportable architectures for Dash Core (I only test 64 Intel), but that is a
less critical side benefit. Local personal testing will continue though.</p>

<p><strong>Most of my cost is time. Sometimes, a lot of time.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hard costs:

<ul>
<li>Personal developer laptop: $0 for now</li>
<li>VPS instances for testing: 3 x $5 per month</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time: est. ave. 10 hours a week at $50 per hour, let's call it $2000 per month</li>
</ul>

<p>The above calculatoin easily ballparks $2000 per month on the open market or
approximately 215 DASH / month as of this writing. But, for now, I am really
just asking for an offsetting donation of DASH for my time. So I propose...</p>

<h4>
<a id="terms" class="anchor" href="#terms" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Terms</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>450 DASH total</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>150 DASH per month</strong></li>
<li><strong>3 months</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>After 3 months, we will examine at how things are going and likely renew with a
similar proposal.</p>

<h3>
<a id="closing" class="anchor" href="#closing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Closing</h3>

<p>Dash Core and its corresponding suite of tooling needs to be properly supported
on the Red Hat family of linux distributions. The software needs to be
professional built, tested,  packaged, improved and maintained over time. I am
providing some of that now and want to continue doing that well into the future.
The goodwill of the community is compensation enough, but if you can find it in
you to help monetarily, it would be most welcome. Thank you!</p>
